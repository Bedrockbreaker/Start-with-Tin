# Start-with-Tin
Factorio Mod to fix Mod issues

- Long Description:

Due to large mods being thrown together, I had the terrible problem of not being to able to research tin to create the lab to research how to process tin. So this mod makes the player start with 4 tin plates, to be able to craft the lab. Also adds a 
an inefficient recipe (to deter players from using that over the other mods default recipe) to create science packs 1 that don't require tin.
